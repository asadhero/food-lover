            <p>Kick off your year of chocolate with something dark and decadent: chocolate blackout cake. With three

            <p>Marinating chicken, peppers and onions and then grilling them gives this dish lots of flavor without much
                fat. An accompaniment of spiced creamy yogurt sauce, avocado sauce and fresh cilantro in a corn tortilla
                keep the fajitas healthy and fresh tasting.</p>

            <p>This soup is for Asian-food lovers. If you have all the ingredients on hand it's easy to put together and
                makes the perfect comfort food. If not, it only takes one trip the Asian market. It's so versatile you
                can make it vegetarian or substitute chicken for shrimp. Enjoy!!
